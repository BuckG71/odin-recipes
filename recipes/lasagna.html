        <li>Then add half the vegan bolognese and spread it into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Then add a thin layer of vegan cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Then add a layer of sliced zucchini.</li>
        <li>Then add all the vegan ricotta into one thick layer.</li>
        <li>Then add 4 sheets of spinach lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Then add another layer of marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Then add another thin layer of vegan cheese sauce, leaving the remainder to add on last.</li>

        <li>Then add another 4 sheets of spinach lasagna noodles.</li>
